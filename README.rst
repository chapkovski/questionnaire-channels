Feeding questions till they are all answered
=============================================

This app reads `quiz1.csv` and then feeds the questions to a client till he/she answers all the questions correctly.

It chooses the type of the question randomly (either open or multiple choice).

It tracks number of attempts as well as time spent per answer.

Most of the logic is in `consumers.py` and `models.py`.
